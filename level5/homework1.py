#we changed dog_name2 from John to Max by writing the same name but with other meaning in new line. 

print("first dog's name is" + " " + dog_name1 + ". " + "second dog's name is" + " " + dog_name2 + ".")

#we did that because we wanted to change dog_name2's meaning and print sentence 'second dog's name is Max'. Not John.
