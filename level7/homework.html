<h1>my appearence</h1>
    <p>Let's start. My name is Melania,i'm 15 years old, my birthday is May 21. I have dark brown,a bit curly and messy hair. I don't really have a specific clothing style,but i prefer oversize outfit,I don't like clothes that are too dark and boring,also i don't like skirts and dresses, they are uncomfortable. I usually wear something bright but not too flashy.</p>
<h2>character</h2>
    <p>I think i have a bit strange character. Most of time i'm the type of 'quiet kid', but not as long as i fit in company and start feeling more comfortable. after that i'm going to be a little bit childish,too energic, might even say crazy.</p>
